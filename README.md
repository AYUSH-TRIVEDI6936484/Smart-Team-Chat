# Smart Team Chat UI

🚀 **Minimal React prototype** demonstrating how AI can enhance team communication with suggestions, summaries, and prompts.  
*(Built as part of the “Intern Task – Smart Team Chat UI” assignment.)*

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to showcase **AI-first UI/UX** concepts in a lightweight chat interface.  
No real backend or chat integration is included—only **placeholders** for AI-powered features.

## 📱 Features (Deliverables)

### 1. Chat List
